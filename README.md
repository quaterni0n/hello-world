# hello-world
Feeling great to start coding and learning new things - feels like entering a new world full of passionate people who are creating the future as I type this..
Honestly, when I think about coding, I am learning more when I let my intuition guide me on what can be the next steps.
I will be interacting more with the developer community in order to understand this space better.
For sure, I will be a goood coder in next 1 year.
That's the aim.

Just trying to do more branching. It feels intuitive.
